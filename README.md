# Another look at the guitar fretboard

A (simple and logic) look at the guitar fretboard using memory tricks, colors and visual representation of the relation between notes.

## Tips

Letâ€™s focus on the 7 natural notes (the white piano keys : C-D-E-F-G-A-B) in the first place, it will helps reduce the amount of information to grasp. 

Break correspond to the frets at which the 2 semi-tones patterns breaks (B-C and E-F are only one semi-tones apart).
1st / 5th / 6th strings : start respectively at fret #1 because their previous (root) notes are E - B - E.
