# Another look at the guitar fretboard
A (simple and logic) look at the guitar fretboard using memory tricks, colors and visual representation of the relation between notes.

This simple and straight-foward manual is meant to introduce to beginners the guitar fretboard (in standard E tuning).
It is menat to facilitate the assimilation using memory tricks, colors and visual representation of the relation between notes on the fretboard.

## Pre-requisite
You should understand the simple "12 notes divided" relationships of notes in the [chromatic scale scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) (used in Western music) before going on.

## Key points
First, let's focus on the 7 natural notes (the white piano keys : C-D-E-F-G-A-B), it will helps reduce the amount of information to grasp.

## Practical definitions
Open chord : an open chord (or open-position chord) is a chord that includes one or more strings that are not fingered while playing the chord.

## Tips
The break column correspond to the frets at which the 2 semi-tones patterns breaks (B-C and E-F are the only natural notes that are one semi-tones apart).
1st / 5th / 6th strings : start respectively at fret #1 because their previous (root) notes are E - B - E (= one semi-tone from the open string).

## Tones
This simple array represents the guitar fretboard. 
It displays the intervals between naturals notes.
T : 1 tone
S : 1 semi-tone
The first and last column shows frets position and the 3, 5, 7, 9 & 12 (marked ones on the fretboard) are grey higlighted.

## Fretboard as an array
This array represent the notes sorted by fret apparition (the box underneath just recap the array in a linear reading way).
