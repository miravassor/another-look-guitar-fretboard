# Another look at the guitar fretboard
  A (simple and logic) look at the guitar fretboard for beginners.  
  
  This simple and straight-foward manual is meant as an introduction for guitar beginners curious about diving into the guitar fretboard (in standard E tuning).  
  It is meant to facilitate the assimilation using memory tricks, colors and visual representation of the relation between notes on the fretboard (the last being respresented as an array).  

## Pre-requisite
  You should understand the simple "12 divided notes" relationships of notes in the [chromatic scale scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) (used in western music) before going on.  
  Make you sure that you get the reading direction of strings, the first one being the fattest one, the lower pitched E followed by the A string.  
  We could represent the strings ordered from farrest to you to closet (if you play a right-handed guitar) with  
```c
e ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
B ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
G ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
D ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
A ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
E ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
```
  
## Practical definitions
  Open string : an open string is a string strummed while playing a chord without any finger on that particular string.  
    ex: the E Major triad where only 3 fingers are on strings but all strings are strummed.  

## Key points
  First, let's focus on the 7 natural notes (aka the white piano keys : C-D-E-F-G-A-B), it will helps reduce the amount of information to grasp.  

## The 2 semi-tones pattern
  The 2 semi-tones pattern simply means that the interval between all natural notes is 2 semi-tones (2 semitones = 1 tone) apart, except from B to C and E to F.   
  
  1st (E)/ 5th (B)/ 6th (E) strings : "starts" respectively at fret #1 because their previous (root) notes are E - B - E (= one semi-tone from the open string note).  
  
  2nd / 3rd / 4th strings  : "starts" respectively at fret #2 because their previous (root) notes are A - D - G. (= one tone from the open string note).  

## Tones
  This simple array represents the guitar fretboard. We will be using this scheme all manual. 
  This particular one displays the intervals between naturals notes. 
    T : 1 tone  
    S : 1 semi-tone  
  The first and last lines shows frets position and the 3, 5, 7, 9 & 12 frets (marked ones on your fretboard) are light-grey higlighted.  
  The often circle(s) present at this particulars frets are here to help you find your position down the neck.  

## Fretboard as an array
  This array represent the notes sorted by fret apparition (the box underneath just recap the array in a linear classic reading way).  
  The break column correspond to the frets at which the 2 semi-tones patterns breaks (so B-C and E-F).

  Watching it vertically like this helps seeing patterns like the full fret coverage for the 5th, 10th and 12th frets.  

## Fretboard notes
  This array represent all the naturals note with a single color for each.
