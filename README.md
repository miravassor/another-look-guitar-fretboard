# Another look at the guitar fretboard
  A look at the guitar fretboard for beginners or more advanced player.  
  
  This simple and straight-foward manual is meant as an introduction for guitar players curious about diving into the guitar fretboard (in standard E tuning).  
  
  It is meant to facilitate the assimilation using memory tricks, colors and visual representation of the relation between notes on the fretboard (being respresented as an array but, you'l see).  

## Pre-requisite
  You should understand the simple "12 equally divided" (aka equal-tempered) relationships of notes in the [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) (used in western music), we will cover this briefly.  
  
  Make you sure that you get right the reading direction of strings, the last one being the fattest one, the lower pitched E precedeed by the 5th string, A.  
  We could represent the strings ordered from farrest to you to closest (if you play a right-handed guitar, otherwise, pleae read the appendix about left handed guitars) with  
```c
e ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| 1
B ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| 2
G ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| 3
D ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| 4
A ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| 5
E ||-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-| 6
```  
  * __e__ = 1st string, we will use this lowercase e to differs from the 6th string E  
  We will use this notation __NfX__ to simplify talking about fret position,  
  *N* being the note digit, *f* the indicator we are reffering to frets (and not octaves as the notation C3 indicates), and *X* the fret number  
  * the writing Df8 means "on the eighth fret of the fourth string (D)"  
  * the writing ef1 means "on the first fret of the first string (e)"  

## Quick cheatsheet
* 1 octave = 12 notes *(C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B)* = 12 semi-tones
* 2 semi-tones = 1 tone
* The 12 notes of the octave are all the black and white keys in one octave on the pianoâ€”form [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale)

* Going down a string on the fretboard equals to going __higher__ in pitch  
  
## Practical definitions
  Open string : an open string is a string strummed while playing a chord without any finger on that particular string.  
    *ex1: the E Major triad where only 3 fingers are on strings but all strings are played/strummed.*  
    *ex2: If you play all your strings of you guitar without any finger on the fretboard, you play only open strings.*  
 We will refers to the open strings as ef0/Bf0/Gf0/Df0/Af0/Ef0

## Key points
  * First, let's focus on the 7 natural notes (aka the white piano keys : C-D-E-F-G-A-B), it will helps reduce the amount of information to grasp.  
  * We will only look at the 12 first frets because at the 12th one, it just start again from the open chords notes (E-A-D-G-B-E) and keep going in the same order, one octave higher.  

## The 2 semi-tones pattern
  The 2 semi-tones pattern simply means that the intervals between all natural notes is 2 semi-tones apart, __except from B to C and E to F__.  
  
 * 1st/5th/6th strings : naturals "starts" respectively at fret #1 because their previous (root) notes are E - B - E (= starts one semi-tone from the open string note).  
  
 * 2nd/3rd/4th strings : naturals "starts" respectively at fret #2 because their previous (root) notes are A - D - G. (= starts one tone from the open string note).  

## Tones
  This simple array represents the guitar fretboard. We will be using this scheme all manual.  
  
  This particular one displays the intervals between naturals notes.  
  * T : 1 tone  
  * S : 1 semi-tone    
    
  The first and last lines shows frets position and the 3, 5, 7, 9 & 12 frets (marked ones on your board) are light-grey higlighted.  
  *The often circular shapes present at this particulars frets are here to help you find your position down the neck, use them!*

## Octaves

If we only look at the 6th strings (E), there is one octave between Ef0 (= E) and Ef12 (= E, one octave higher).  
So, any octave of any note in the same string can be found 12th frets down.  
More interestingly, finding the octave of a note on the precedant string is done by following this 12th octave rule, after going down, going up 5 frets on the adjacent string (the previous one) gives you the exact same note (the "12th fret down" octave).

The red E (aka Ef0) is the E open string. Going down 12th fret gives us the octave below, in Ef12.  
The same note is found using the +12/-5(up) semi-tones formula on the A string.  
Both E12 and A7 have the exact same pitch !  

Going a step further, at the 7th fret you find the octave of the previous string, __except for the G__, wich is found 1 semi-tone after, on __fret 8__.

## Fretboard as an array
  This array represent the notes sorted by fret apparition (the box underneath just recap the array in a classical reading way).  
  * The break column correspond to the frets at which the 2 semi-tones patterns breaks (so B>C and E>F).

  Watching it vertically like this helps seeing patterns :
  * the 5th, 10th and 12th frets are all covered with natural notes, respectively the 3rd, 6th and 7th naturals of the strings.

## Fretboard notes
  This array represent all the naturals note with a single color for each.

## Bonus : The perfect Tetris
Maybe my fav, if you play tetris with the right at bottom, you score big time!

### Appendix

## Left Handed guitars
I'm sorry I had to make this manual to reach the most of players. It will be probably less viually proeficient as every array is not in the right order for you but I encourage you, if you may, to make your own arrays at this is a great way to learn.  
If you don't know it already, you need have to flip every chord with its opposite (1 become 6, 2 become 4)...
Good luck !
