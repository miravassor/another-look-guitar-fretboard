A (simple and logic) look at the guitar fretboard using memory tricks, colors and visual representation of the relation between notes.

## Tips

Break correspond to the fret(s) at which the 2 semi-tones patterns breaks (B-C and E-F are only one semi-tones apart).
1st / 5th / 6th strings : start respectively at fret #1 because their previous (root) notes are E - B - E.
